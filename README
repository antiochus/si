SI is a primitive, but simple Space Invaders emulator.

It was written some time ago (1998 - 2000) as a way to learn more about low level programming and CPU architecture.
The original target of the program was MS-DOS, so it may need some changes to run on a modern OS.

The entire code is written in pure C and should be pretty straight forward to understand.
